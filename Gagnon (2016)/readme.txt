Thanks for downloading these replication materials for the paper "Understanding the 
New Normal: The Role of Demographics" by Etienne Gagnon, Benjamin Johannsen, and 
David Lopez-Salido. The paper was accepted for publication in the IMF Economic Review in
January 2021.

To economize disk space, these materials include all input files needed to recreate the
filtered data, simulations results, and figures but not the output files generated by those
programs. A set of replication materials inclusive of all output files can be downloaded 
at the web page www.etiennegagnon.com. 


By unzipping these materials to your favorite directory, you will create four folders: 

Data		Contains the demographic and technology data that we plot in the paper and use in the 
		simulations. It also contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that prepare the raw data to be 
		read by our model files. See GJLS_readme_data.ipynb or GJLS_readme_data.pdf for instructions
		on the replication of the "New Normal" model results.

Model		Contains the model files, which are coded either as Jupyter notebooks or in Julia. See 
		GJLS_readme_model.ipynb or GJLS_readme_model.pdf for instructions on the replication of the 
		"New Normal" data inputs.  The notebooks GJLS_model_IRF.ipynb and GJLS_plot_IRF.ipynb create 
		impulse reponses to shocks to fertility and life expectancy and plot the results, respectively. 
		The baseline simulation of the model must have been run before executing these files to provide 
		a no-shock baseline. For the pandemic simulations, see Pandemic_readme.ipynb or Pandemic_readme.pdf. 

Rstar_sims	Folder where the simulations are exported.

Figures 		Contains the R programs used to create the figures in the paper.



Prior to filtering the raw data, running the model files, or creating the figures, one needs to install 
Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install) and the programming languages Julia (Julialang.org)
and R (https://www.r-project.org/ or https://www.rstudio.com/). Two of the readme files are Jupyter 
notebooks.
