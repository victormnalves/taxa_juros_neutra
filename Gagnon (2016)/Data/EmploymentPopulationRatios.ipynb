    "# Employment-Population Ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook extracts yearly and quarterly employment-population ratios (EPRs) by age and birth cohort from 1900 to 2100. These EPRs are used to calibrate individual labor endowments in the model. The EPRs are defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$EPR=100\\times \\frac{\\text{Number of Persons Employed}}{\\text{Civilian Non-Institutional Population}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of EPRs by age and birth cohort over an extended sample period requires a bit of data manipulation to deal with sparse data before 1967 and to project ongoing trends in the labor supply of older workers. The time series must also be filtered to remove business cycle variation, which our model does not seek to explain. The remainder of this introduction presents our approach along with data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating the EPRs before 1967 \n",
    "\n",
    "The historical data underlying the EPRs have been published by the BLS since 1948. However, the published age categories have changed over time. Starting in 1967, we have monthly data by 5-year age bins from 20 to 74 years old, as well as for 16 to 19 years old and 75+ years old. Prior to 1967, we have monthly data for 16 to 19 years old, 20 to 24 years old, and 65+ years old, as well as for 10-year age bins from 25 to 64 years old. Given our interest in low-frequency movements, we initially work with annual data—thus avoiding issues pertaining to seasonal adjustment—and recover quarterly EPR series through cubic spline interpolations of the trend in yearly rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate the EPRs for the missing five-year age bins pre-1967 using information from the 10-year age bins. After inspecting the data, we note that the level of the 25 to 29 years old series and the 30 to 34 series move in roughly equal percentage-point steps with the 25 to 34 series. For these series, we impute the missing pre-1967 levels by making the identifying assumption that the percentage point difference between the series for 25 to 29 years old and for 30 to 34 years old is equal to the difference observed in 1967:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$EPR_{t}^{30 to 34}-EPR_{t}^{25 to 29}=EPR_{1967}^{30 to 34}-EPR_{1967}^{25 to 29}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then back out the missing level for 5-year bins from \n",
    "\n",
    "$$EPR_{t}^{25 to 34}=\\frac{POP_{t}^{25to29}}{POP_{t}^{25to34}}EPR_{t}^{25 to 29}+\\frac{POP_{t}^{30to34}}{POP_{t}^{25to34}}EPR_{t}^{30 to 34}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt the same approach to impute missing statistics by five-year age bins for other prime-age workers, for which the employment-population ratio is fairly constant until 55 years old. We also follow the same approach for workers aged between 55 and 64 years old, although inspection of the data suggests somewhat less stability for that age group. For workers aged 65 years or more, we adopt an imputation procedure that is better suited to capture shifts in labor supply late in life. Upon inspection of the data from 1967 onward, we note that the EPRs for 65 to 69 years old, 70 to 74 years old, and 75+ years old are roughly proportional to each other over time. Our imputation method pre-1967 minimizes a weighted sum of square deviations from the EPRs prevailing in 1967,\n",

    "\n",
    "in a way that is consistent with the published EPRs for the broader age group,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$EPR_{t}^{65+} = \\frac{POP_{t}^{65to69}}{POP_{t}^{65+}}\\times EPR_{t}^{65to69}+\\frac{POP_{t}^{70to74}}{POP_{t}^{65+}} \\times EPR_{t}^{70to74}+\\frac{POP_{t}^{75+}}{POP_{t}^{65+}} \\times EPR_{t}^{75+}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One slight complication for the pre-1967 data is that we do not have estimates of the non-institutional population for all age bins of interest. We simply replace the missing population ratios in the equations above with the corresponding ratios from the U.S. Census estimates of the total population. These estimates are read and cleaned in the notebook \"Migration.ipynb\", which must be run before running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Projecting the EPRs through 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPRs of older workers have been increasing over the past few decades along with life expectancy and health conditions, reversing a pattern of declining EPRs in earlier decades. Our projection of EPRs going forward makes use of the BLS' \"Employment Projections: 2014–24\". The BLS creates these projections to look at employment by industry. Although they do not include projections of EPRs by age in 2024, they do include projections of the labor force participation ratio (LFPR) by age bins. We use that information, along with an assumption about equilibrium employment rates by age, to recover EPRs by age in 2024. In particular, we assume that the labor market in 2015 is in equilibrium and that the unemployment rates by age that prevailed in that year also prevail in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "For individuals aged less than 25 years or more than 54 years, the LFPRs in the Employment Projections directly line up with the EPR age bins derived above. For prime-age workers between the age of 25 and 54 years, the \"Employment Projections: 2014–24\" are structed by ten-year age bins as opposed to five-year age bins. For these age categories, we make the identifying assumption that the percentage-point difference between two contiguous five-year bins is constant between 2014 and 2024, then retrieve the five-year LFPRs consistent with the published ten-year LFPRs. For example, for the 25-34 years old category, we compute $LFPR_{25-29}^{2024}$ using the definition of the LFPR for the 25-34 years old category\n",
    "\n",
    "$$LFPR_{25,34}^{2024} = \\frac{POP_{25-29}^{2024}}{POP_{25-34}^{2024}} \\times LFPR_{25-29}^{2024} + \\frac{POP_{30-34}^{2024}}{POP_{25-34}^{2024}} \\times LFPR_{30-34}^{2024}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the restriction that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$LFPR_{25-29}^{2024}-LFPR_{30-34}^{2024}=LFPR_{25-29}^{2014}-LFPR_{30-34}^{2014}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One minor complication is that the \"Employment Projections: 2014–24\" do not include detailed non-institutional population statistics, so the relative noninstitutional population shares in the above equations are unobserved for 2024. In a manner similar to the imputation of pre-1967 data, we approximate these shares using corresponding data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2014 National Population Projections for the total U.S. population. See the notebook \"Migration.ipynb\" for detailed sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another minor complication is that the historical labor market data have been revised since the publication of the \"Employment Projections: 2014–24\". For this reason, we adjust the level of the 2024 LFPR data such that they imply the same change (as opposed to level) in LFPR by age bins between 2014 and 2024 as reported in the publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2024 LFPRs were downloaded here, www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_303.htm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The EPRs before 1948 and beyond 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "The imputation of EPRs before 1948 is subject to a great deal of uncertainty for several reasons. Notably, the two world wars altered the size and composition of the U.S. labor force. Moreover, home production was arguably more important in light of a large share of the population living in a rural environment. Both of these elements raise questions that are outside of the purview of our model. For this reason, we simply carry back in time the EPRs by age prevailing in 1948.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the projection of EPRs beyond 2024 is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. On the one hand, one might expect further improvement in health and life expectancy to continue to raise the LFPR of older persons. On the other hand, the historical correlation between these variables is very weak outside of recent decades. Moreover, some of the rise in EPRs over the past couple of decades might reflect in part increases in the minimum age at which one becomes eligible to draw social security benefits. Our approach is to simply level off the post-2024 EPRs at their 2024 levels.\n",
