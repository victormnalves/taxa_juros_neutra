"Table 1. Central birth rates, by live-birth order, current age, and race of women in each cohort from 1911 through 1991: United States, 1960-2005",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"[A cohort is identified by the year in which the women were born. Because these women retain this designation throughout their childbearing years, their fertility can be followed over time. Live-birth order refers to number of children born alive to mother. Central birth rates are per 1,000 women in specified single year of age cohort group and are based on births adjusted for underregistration (1960-1979 only) and numbers of women adjusted for misstatements of age in the censuses (1960-2005). For method of computation, see Technical Appendix to the Cohort Fertility Tables]",,,,,,,,,,,
