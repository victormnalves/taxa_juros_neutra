    "# Total Factor Productivity\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses historical data on Total Factor Productivity compiled by John Fernald and downloaded from the San Francisco Fed's website at the following link: http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/\n",
    "\n",
    "More documentation on the methodology can be found on the website as well as the accompanying Excel spreadsheet. The data were downloaded on September 28, 2020, and run from 1947:Q2 to 2020:Q2. We only read data through 2019:Q4 to avoid the pandemic period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program extends the Fernald series forward in time using projections made by Robert J. Gordon in his paper \"Secular Stagnation on the Supply Side: U.S. Productivity Growth in the Long Run\" (link: http://economics.weinberg.northwestern.edu/robert-gordon/files/RescPapers/SecularStagnation.pdf). Gordon estimates that total factor productivity will grow at a annual rate of 1.1 percent per year through 2032, a rate that we extend beyond that date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program also extends the Fernald series back in time using an informed guess of average technology growth in earlier decades. The rate chosen---2 percent---is in the middle of the range of estimates surveyed by Shackleton (2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note, the TFP growth measure constructed by Fernald (2014) nets out the contribution of labor quality growth, which averages about 0.25 percentage point on an annualized basis. By contrast, the estimates of Shackleton (2013) and Gordon (2015) conflate labor quality growth with TFP growth. To ensure consistency across data sources and with our model, which does not feature labor quality growth, we add back the contribution of labor quality growth to Fernald's estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program also exports Fernald's estimate of the log change in labor quality, $\\Delta log(HQ_{t})$. We extend the series backward and forward in time using the average growth for the Fernald (2014) series. This series-wide average is close to that observed in the first and last 10 years, though wider swings can be observed in the decades in between. We used the resulting series in an unpublished exploration of the effect of including growth in human capital in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our model does not seek to explain high-frequency movements in the equilibrium real rate, GDP, and other aggregate variables. For this reason, we feed our model with a smoothed version of the quarterly (log) TFP growth series. To create this smoothed series, we first convert our extended Fernald TFP growth series to levels and then HP filter the log of the series to extract a smooth trend. We finally convert the smoothed level series back to growth rates (measured in log changes).\n",
