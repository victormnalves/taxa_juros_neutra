    "# Mortality Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "This program extracts yearly and quarterly mortality rates from 1900 to 2220 by age and birth cohort. The approach uses information from the \"Life Tables for the United States Social Security Area 1900-2100\" computed by Bell and Miller (2005). These tables are provided for each decade from 1900 to 2100 by years of age, so they must be interpolated to obtain more granular mortality rates at a quarterly frequency and by calendar year. Our interpolation below uses cubic splines for both age and calendar year period. Because we have estimates of mortality rates by age for an individual born in 2100 up to 120 years of age, we effective have usable information through 2200. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program returns the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{interp_death_rate_1900_2220_Y.csv}$: A 120x320 matrix whose elements $\\gamma_{a,t}$ correspond to the annual marginal probabilities of death of individuals aged $a$ years in the calendar year $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{interp_death_rate_1900_2220_Q.csv}$: A 480x1280 matrix whose elements $\\gamma_{a,t}$ correspond to the annualized quarterly marginal probabilities of death of individuals aged $a$ in period $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{age_years.csv}$: A 120x1 array whose elements are the mid-points of the years of age.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{age_quarters.csv}$: A 480x1 array whose elements are the mid-points of the quarters of age.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{interp_death_rate_table6_1900_Y.csv}$: A 120x1 array whose elements $\\gamma_{a,1}$ correspond to the annualized probability of death per year of age based on marginal mortality rates of individuals aged $a$ at the turn of 1900.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{interp_death_rate_table6_1900_Q.csv}$: A 480x1 array whose elements $\\gamma_{a,1}$ correspond to the annualized probability of death per quarter of age based on marginal mortality rates of individuals aged $a$ at the turn of 1900. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data were originally downloaded from https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html. We use information from two sets of tables in Bell and Miller (2005) to derive the $\\gamma_{a,t}$. Table 6 reports probabilities of death for a person of a given age (in years) and gender at the turn of a particular decade. Table 7 reports annualized probabilities of death by years of age and gender for an individual born at the turn of a particular decade. The interpolation uses all available information from the two sets of tables. The distance between data points can vary based on data availability. For each age, the interpolation is performed using the mortality rates for all periods available.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difficulty is that the statistics are provided for each gender but not for the total population. Our approach is to interpolate the information by gender first, then aggregate this information across gender. To do so, we assume that the ratio of live male births to female live births---which we call the 'mfratio'---is 1.05. This figure aligns with the historical times-series analysis of Matthews and Hamilton (2005). Their historical sample covers the period 1940 to 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond 2100, we only have sparse mortality rate information on cohorts that were born in 2100 or earlier. We assume that the mortality rates for future cohorts are that same as for the 2100 cohort. Prior to 1900, we have no information on mortality rates by age. For simplicity, we assume that the mortality rates in the cross section of 1900 also apply in all previous periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the probability of death must be stricly less than 1 in all periods of age to ensure that all of our data filters and programs run well.  Otherwise, some matrix operations will return NaN values due to invertibility issues, leading to errors during the execution. The life-cycle tables for the early decades in the sample have death rate estimates at 100 percent for the oldest centenarians. The simple fix is to cap their probability of death at a high value strictly below 1---we choose 90 percent per year. This death rate is sufficiently high that the assumption has no incidence on the steady-state population distribution.\n",
