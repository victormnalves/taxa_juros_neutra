    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to simulate the overlapping-generations model from the paper \"Understanding the New Normal: The Role of Demographics\" by Etienne Gagnon, David Lopez-Salido, and Benjamin Johannsen. The paper was accepted for publication in IMF Economic Review in January 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed descriptions of the model and solution method are contained in the technical appendix to the paper. The materials below provide additional information on the supporting programs.\n",

    "## Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "All model files and data cleaning/organizing programs are written in the Julia programming language using the platform Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a programming language developed for high performance dynamic programming and numerical computing. Its syntax is similar to those of Python, R, and Matlab whereas its performance can approach that of C in some applications. Julia is free and open source. The language can be installed at [Julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Our code is written using version 1.5.3.\n",

    "### Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter provides a framework for creating interactive code as well as allowing seamless integration of formatted text with computational code and results. Unlike a static presentation using a program such as $\\LaTeX$, Jupyter's \"notebooks\" can include both text and code in selected programming languages. These replication materials are created in Jupyter notebooks. To download and install Jupyter, please look [here](https://jupyter.org/install). For a complete list of languages that can be used with Jupyter notebooks, all current kernels are listed at this [site](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).

    "### `calibeta.jl`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main function that launches the model simulations. It can take arguments that adjust the model and simulation parameters as desired (see descriptions of our calls at the end of this notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of this function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads the requisite functions and data types.\n",
    "2. Loads the demographic and technology data through call of `read_data.jl`.\n",
    "3. Call `set_targets.jl` to create the target mean $r_{t}$ value in the 1980s.\n",
    "4. Set the parameters of the model and simulation through calls of `set_pars.jl` and  `set_simpars.jl`. \n",
    "5. Initiate the search for $\\beta$ and the associated solution through call of `calibeta_bisection.jl` and save the data.\n",
    "6. Save the simulation results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `calibeta_bisection.jl`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file sets up the bisection search for the value of $\\beta$ such that the equilibrium interest rate path in the 1980s matches that of Johannsen and Mertens (2017). A low and a high value of $\\beta$ must be provided when iterating over beta. If the simulation takes $\\beta$ as given, then only the low value needs to be provided. Each guess of $\\beta$ must be  accompanied with two pairs of low and high guesses of $R_{t}$ in the balanced-growth equilibriums consistent with the demographic variables at the beginning and end of the simulation period. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of this function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the model and simulation parameters. \n",
    "2. Given the low guess of $\\beta$, call `GE_search.jl` to find the associated general equilibrium solution and then calculate the mean rate of interest targeted. \n",
    "3. Proceed similarly for the  high guess of $\\beta$.\n",
    "4. With the bisection of $\\beta$ seeded, iteratively compute a solution for the mid-point of the range of $\\beta$ values until the targeted mean interest rate has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GE_search.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the balanced-growth solution for the turn of 1900, which is used to seed the simulation under both perfect foresight and backward-looking expectations. \n",
    "    - To this end, the program first computes a balanced-growth population and dependency structure through a call of `Compute_population.jl` imposing that the 1900:Q1 demographic parameters last forever.\n",
    "    - The program then uses a bisection method to search for the balanced-growth value of $R^{*}$ consistent with the population distribution. In particular, for a given guess of $R^{*}$, it computes two measures of the aggregate capital stock. \n",
    "        - The first measure, $K^{mpk}$, is the capital stock consistent with $R^{*}$ and the growth rates of the labor supply and technology based on the firm's first-order condition with respect to capital. \n",
    "        - The second measure, $K^{hh}$, is the aggregate capital stock based on aggregating individual household decisions given the population. \n",
    "        - When seeding the bisection, the low guess of $R^{*}$ should be such that $K^{mpk}>K^{*}>K^{hh}$. Intuitively, a low value of $R^{*}$ encourages capital accumulation by firms but discourages capital accumulation by households. Conversely, the high guess of $R^{*}$ should have the reverse ordering. If the guesses are both too low or too high, then the values of `pars.seedR1900` should be adjusted accordingly. \n",
    "    - The balanced-growth solution given by the low and high guesses of $R^{*}$ is computed through a call of the `BG_search_bisection.jl` function.\n",
    "3. Calculate the population and dependency structures in the actual population via a call to `Compute_population.jl`.\n",
    "4. The program next computes the dynamic solution conditional on the capital holdings and interest rate carried into the initial period. This step differs between the solutions under perfect foresight and backwards-looking expectations.\n",
    "    - Perfect foresight: Pass demographic and technology data to the function `GE_search_solution.jl`.\n",
    "    - Backward-looking expectations: \n",
    "        - First, create a set of counterfactual demographic expectations from the point of view of the first period in the simulation. For a rolling window of `pars.hhexpectations` periods, the algorithm computes the mean demographic variables for the current and past `pars.hhexpectations`$-1$ periods. 1900:Q1 values are used for periods in the window that fall before the start of the simulation. The actual demographic variables are always used for the current period to ensure that the solution to the household and firm problems are consistent with each other. \n",
    "        - Second, compute the general-quilibrium solution under the counterfactual demographic variables through a call of `GE_search_solution.jl`. \n",
    "        - Third, save the aggregate solution for the current period as well as the capital holdings carried into the next period. Then move the start of the simulation by one period and repeat these three steps. \n",
    "        - Continue to iterate on these steps until a solution conditional on backward-looking expectations has been computed from the point of view of every period to be displayed. Because the general-equilibrium solution is computed hundreds of times, it takes up to a day to obtain a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `GE_search_solution.jl`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function computes the general-equilibrium solution given demographic data and initial conditions for the distribution of household asset holdings and the previous-period interest rate. It starts with a guess of the aggregate object paths and then gradually adjusts those paths in the direction that makes them consistent with the aggregation of household decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of this function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the population and dependency structure consistent with the assumed path of the demographic variables through a call of `Compute_population.jl`. \n",
    "2. Compute the balanced-growth solution for the last period in the simulation.\n",
    "3. Use the balanced-growth solutions for the first and last periods of the simulation to initialize the path of aggregate variables. \n",
    "4. Given the path of aggregate variables, solve the household problem for each period in the simulation and aggregate the decisions to derive new paths.\n",
    "5. Measure the distance between the new paths and the old paths. Stop if the difference meets the numerical convergence criterion. Otherwise update the path of aggregate variables in the direction of the new paths. Keep updating until numerical convergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances, it is found that the update toward the new paths should be slow to ensure convergenge to the general-equilibrium solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Compute_population.jl`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function computes the resident population, measured at the end of each period, between 1900:Q1 and 2399:Q4 under specific demographic assumptions. It takes the baseline demographic information for the 1900:Q1-2099:Q4 period contained in the structure `data` and, where relevant, extends those data through 2399:Q4. In this extension, the variables guiding the computation of the population in 2099:Q4 are carried foward for all subsequent periods, so that population dynamics are consistent with the economy reaching a balanced growth state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Four key parameters determine how the population is recursively created:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `use_birth`: If true, the function grows the population through exogenous births. Otherwise, it grows the population through exogenous fertility rates.\n",
    "* `fixed_birth`: If true and `use_birth==true`, then live births are assumed to grow at the preset rate `pars.n`.\n",
    "* `migration`: If true, then the net migration values in `data.net_migration_Q` are added to the population at the beginning of every period. Otherwise, the function sets net migration to zero for all ages and periods.\n",
    "* `extra_birthgr`: If true, this option allows the user to add a fixed number of extra basis points to the exogenous growth rate of live births to all periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "During execution, the function creates the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data.fitted_age_marriage`: Median age difference in years between men and women at time of first marriage (vector, 2000x1).\n",
    "* `data.share_births_mothers`: Share of births in period accruing to mothers aged 14 to 49 years of age (matrix, 144x2000).\n",
    "* `data.net_migration_Q`: Net number of migrants of a given age at beginning of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "* `data.births_interpolated`: Annualized number of births at beginning of period (vector, 2000x1).\n",
    "* `data.death_rate`: Death rate affecting resident population and net migrants alive at beginning of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "* `Population`: Population by age alive at end of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "* `Parent_child`: Number of kids by age of their parent at end of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "* `Dependents`: Number of kids of a given age dependent on parent of a given age at end of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "* `Parent_newborns`: Number of newborns per parent of a given age at end of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "* `Parent_fertility`: Fertility rate by age of parent, measured at end of period (matrix, 480x2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using live births to grow the population, the function returns the (end-of-period) fertility rates consistent with the population. Conversely, when using fertility rates, the function returns a birth series. Also, the function leaves the original 'data' series unchanged because model simulations may use these demographic data in several manners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function provides the option of fixing the fertility rates, the mortality rates, or both to the values observed in the period immediately before a specified date. For example, by setting `pars.per_fix_frate=320`, the population computations from 1980:Q1 onward would be based on the assumption that the fertility rates are unchanged at their 1979:Q4 values. Similarly, setting `pars.per_fix_grate=320` would leave the mortality rates constant from 1980:Q1 onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing a counterfactual population under backward-looking expectations, the `data` structure input should contain the demographic variables expected by households. To ensure that the counterfactual population aligns with the actual population in the initial period, the demographic variables for that period should match the actual ones. If that is not the case, then the aggregation of the household and firm decisions would not align with the general equilibrium values for that initial period. \n",

A later start allows us to check the sensitivity of our findings to using later initialization periods, as other authors such as Eggerston et al. (2018) do. The function requires estimates of the population in period immediately before the start of the simulation, which we read from the output of `FertilityRates.pynb`. This function has not been adapted to update the family dependency structure.
